# calc-rs

A simple interpreter written in Rust, which can only evaluate equations so far. Supports order of operations, no support for brackets yet.

Completely written from scratch with a custom lexer/tokeniser, parser to create an AST, and interpreter. Very small at the moment.

This is likely very broken in many ways, so please feel free to open a PR if you notice anything specific, since this is my first Rust project.

To build and run it, simply run `cargo run` in the project directory.
